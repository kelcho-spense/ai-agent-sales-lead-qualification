# AI-powered Sales Lead Qualification System

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered **Sales Lead Qualification** system built using **Nest.js**, **Azure AI Search**, and **Azure Cosmos DB**. It automates the process of analyzing incoming sales inquiries, qualifying leads based on historical data and engagement patterns, and storing lead profiles, qualification scores, and communication logs in Azure Cosmos DB.

The AI agent evaluates the potential of sales leads, prioritizes them, and ensures your sales team focuses on leads that have the highest probability of conversion.

## Features
- **Automated Lead Qualification**: The AI agent evaluates sales leads based on customer inquiries and engagement data.
- **CRM Integration**: Seamless workflow integration with sales CRM systems to manage leads.
- **AI-driven Insights**: Uses **Azure AI Search** to pull relevant historical data for more accurate lead qualification.
- **Lead Data Management**: Stores and updates lead profiles, qualification scores, and communication logs in **Azure Cosmos DB**.
- **Easy Deployment**: Fully deployable in any Azure environment with minimal setup.

## Technologies Used
- **Nest.js**: Backend framework to build the server-side application.
- **Azure AI Search**: Search service to retrieve customer engagement data for lead qualification.
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: NoSQL database for storing lead profiles, communication logs, and qualification results.
- **Azure AI Agent**: AI model integration for automated decision-making and lead scoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally or deploy to your own environment, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Azure Subscription**: For setting up **Azure AI Search**, **Azure Cosmos DB**, and **Azure AI Agent Service**.
- **Nest.js CLI**: For running and managing the application locally.
